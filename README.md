# BSQ
Algorithm that finds the biggest square on a map given.</br>
I realized this program as part of a school project at Epitech Technology.

## How to test it?ü§î
- After downloading the repository from Github, simply go in from your
terminal and compile the program with the `make` command

- You can now test the program from the terminal with the
command `./bsq [path of map]`

Example: `./bsq maps-intermediate/mouli_maps/intermediate_map_100_100`

## Warning‚ùó
For biggest maps, it is recommended to store the result in a file and
then view it for a problem of execution time and display.</br>
To do so, use the following command:
`./bsq [path of map] > [name of the file that will be created]`</br>
You can now view the file in a classic text editor.
