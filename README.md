# Epitech-BSQ
Algorithm that finds the biggest square on a map given.

# How to test it?
- After downloading the program, simply go to its folder from your
terminal and compile it with the "make" command.

- You can now test the program from the terminal with the
command "./bsq [path of map]".

  Example: "./bsq maps-intermediate/mouli_maps/intermediate_map_100_100"

# Warning
For biggest maps, it is recommended to store the result in a file and
then view it for a problem of execution time and display.
To do so, use the following command:
"./bsq [path of map] > [file name that will be created]".
You can now view the file in a classic text editor.
